EDX 3a Question For the on-key and on-mouse function, would we be given the templates or do we need know how to create them on our own? 
Zoom Pool Graded? Will today’s lecture be graded?
Question on temapate for htdf I know we do not have to comment the templates out , but I keep seeing them commented out in the solutions. This makes me think if I misunderstood the rules and I actually have to comment them out. Should I..?
ctr-y Would ctr-y be height/2 -1 or no plus one.
Lecture 5 Prework - Question 5 On edX Edge module 3a: How to Design Worlds / Improving a World Program - Add key handler, it says that the page is for questions 3 to 5, but there are only 2 questions  on the page. This is a very minor issue, but it is mildly confusing.

Cowabunga Problem from Videos - Render Function The video says that we need a separate helper function to choose the correct cow image :;; render function renders the image                                CTR-Y               MTS;; choose-image chooses the image   0      COW-IMG-R      COW-IMG-LBut we could have also defined the render function in the purpose as follows:;; Displays the right cow image if speed is positive;;  produce the left cow image&lt;examples and stub&gt;&lt;template&gt;   0                         CTR-Y                   MTS                         CTR-Y                   MTSWill we be told whether we need a helper function or not?
Spider Lecture Hi, I wonder why we should define MID in the first image.And in the second image, Autograder said there are in one or more invalid tests and it is 100% after I deleted the test of . Is it because it doesn&#39;t match the code from TA or I should not include this test at all? Thank you.

Zoom polls In today&#39;s lesson, I wasn&#39;t able to answer the first question because of a problem with Zoom did not show the poll. However, I was able to answer the last three questions. Will today&#39;s poll affect the grade? Where should I go to report this?
How to do check-expects for irrational numbers? Hi I was wondering how to do a check-expect on a irrational number. For example if an expected result is ? I searched the helpdesk and found something called check-within, but it requires an extra parameter called delta that I&#39;m not too sure about. Thanks in advance for any answers!

TOP versus BOT Hi! Could someone please explain how we calculated TOP and BOT from today&#39;s HTDW lecture? Why subtract one from the BOT but not add one to the TOP? I am confused about how both were calculated, even with the 0-indexing rule. If anyone could clarify, it would be really helpful!
LAB 2 HelloI already attended lab 2 on Friday. At that time I was not registered in any lab section. Now I am registered in lab section for Tuesday, i.e. today. So do I need to attend today&#39;s lab class or not, which will be doing lab 2 itself?

Question about primitive data and non-primitive data Do all of the atomic non-distinct value  beg to primitive data?Do all of the atomic distinct value beg to non-primitive data?Do all of the &#34;one of&#34; parts  beg to non-primitive data?Thanks a lot and have a nice day!
mixed data Capture.PNGIs this a mixed data itemization. I thought itemizations had to have at least one non distinct value in them. Also why not set the last questions to .
Are Dates Atomic Data? If I recall correctly , atomic data is used to represent information that es its meaning when broken down. For example, if you broke down the string &#34;red&#34; into multiple characters &#34;r&#34; &#34;e&#34; and &#34;d&#34;, the meaning of the string  is t.Suppose that you had a date of birth, such as &#34;2000/03/14&#34;. When the string is broken down into individual characters  the meaning is t because the individual digits do not provide any information when separated. However, if the date is broken down into the year, month and day , the individual components still have a meaning.So, is a date  considered atomic or would this information fall under a different category?

How many subclasses are needed for a data definition to be considered a large enumeration? I know that  should only be used for large enumerations, but I&#39;m not entirely sure at what point a data definition can be considered as a large enumeration. In the lecture, I remember a large enumeration being described as an enumeration with 10 or more subclasses, but I wanted to confirm this since I cannot find this information on the design recipes page.

HtDW P1 CountDown Animation Starter I was solving problems in the Problem Bank  and I found out that it states CountDown as Natural in the solution. I wrote my CountDown as Number since it contains &#34;0&#34;. As far as I know, 0 is not a natural number. Can someone explain what I am missing here?
how to compare two equal strings? I want to compare two strings under an i statement, I used = but it says it expected a number for it?Here is my statement: 1       n

Recently changed my lab section I recently changed my lab section  due to schedule conflict with another lab.I already told the TAs in the Thursday section but I wonder whether I should inform the TAs on the Tuesday section before going to the lab on Tuesday. 
lab 2 grade not available yet Hi, I checked my SPD report page, and see that my lab 1 grades and everything  are updated, but I don&#39;t see my lab 2 grades under summary or the TA grading report as of yet. I am wondering if the TA grade has been released yet or is it just me?
Problem Bank Make-Box Starter I was wondering why the Signature of the below function is Color -&gt; Image instead of String -&gt; Image? Color isn&#39;t a primitive and since this problem starter is before HTDD, we can only use primitive types for the signature right?;; You might want to create boxes of different colours.;;;; Use the How to Design Functions  recipe to design a function that;; consumes a color, and creates a solid 10x10 square of that colour. Follow the;; HtDF recipe and leave behind a commented out version of the stub.;; produce a consumed color 10x10 square  ; -image ;stub     
Editing Template May be a stupid question, but are we allowed to edit a template created from HTDD after following all the rules?For example, the HTDD says to create a cond expression with 3 Question Answer pairs, but to make the program work as intended, we need to add a 4th.
Problem set 2 submission What does it mean when Dr racket Says too much memory used?
rules for editing cond questions I have been getting template intact errors quite alot and im ing to understand what are the editing cond question rules i am breaking, ording to my knowledge the only rules i know so far are:- include guards in the cond template of data definition- cond statement include  in itemization but not in enumerationAre there any more rules that i need to know about to prevent getting more template intact errors
Function templates for itemization I am currently watching through the edX videos on itemization, and the template function for CountDown has the expressions  and  in the second cond question. Is it not sufficient to only use  as the second cond question though? I thought we are allowed to trust/assume that functions will only be called with data we define in this course.EDIT: Resolved. This is clarified in the next edX video.
Question about grade report Hi,I&#39;m just wondering if there is any chance that I can improve or replace this lecture mark? For lecture/m02-grade-standing, I took a chance and submitted the answers provided to auto grading because I was sick that day and didn&#39;t have the energy to complete this lecture, but today I completed this assignment on my own with many tries. I just want to know if it is possible that TAs could check my work again and replace the score? 
Course Resources  not visible on edx I can’t see the course resource tabs on the tip of my edx screen. I only see Course, Dates and Discussion. Please advise. 
cond question how do we know what is the correct cond questions to use for a certain data type. In one of the examples they used = but this is not in the htdd data recipe.
HtDD Constraints Since the constraints we create during the HtDD process is just a comment and not actual code, can we assume, when using it in our program, that none of the constraints are being broken? In other words, do we have to create guards for that and set up check-expects to test it? For example, I recall the professor stating that it&#39;s nice to have a check-expect for  strings, so I want to make sure if we still need to check for &#34;&#34; when it&#39;s not one of the options listed when doing HtDD.
Missed Acdemic Integrity Quiz Hi, I realized that I missed the academic Integrity quiz and it is now locked. Is there any way that I am able to complete this? Since it is needed to receive mark on Canvas.
How to Write a Type Predicate for a Natural? I just noticed that when guarding a Natural, the  predicate is used.e.g. in the GradeStanding problem from class:;; GradeStanding is one-of;; - Natural;; - &#34;H&#34;;; - &#34;P&#34;... ]...But  doesn&#39;t exist. Is there any work-around for this?Asking because natural consists only of integers greater than or equal to 0, while number consists of all decimal values from negative infinity to positive infinity.
Check-expects When doing check-expects for different possible cases, should we test for numbers that are out of bound?ie for the grade standing problem, should we test for values that are higher than 100 or lower than 0 or should we assume that the value given will always be within the given parameters
Problem set submission If my partner submitted the problem set,  already, do I have to submit it again? Thank you
interval interval.PNGCan someone explain why this would be interval. Is it because the number of girls in the class can range from 0 to 50? 
Problem set check up during lab I was in the lab and was checked on my problem set 1. My TA said I didn&#39;t indent the code and therefore was only partially correct. I was wondering how this would affect my mark for the problem set?
[SOLVED] final ELSE in Itemization? EDIT FOR NEW VIEWERS: my sincerest apologies, I had made a mistake when reading HtDD... I am very embarassed. I have flagged this post as inappropriate so it may be removed soon.The design recipies page does NOT use a final  when templating for itemization, however, the solution for HtDD NV5 includes a final ELSE in the cond, so I&#39;m not sure as which to follow.I am guessing that both are valid, but I personally find using a final &#34;&#34; is pretty ambiguous when compared with how rigid and explicit all the other programming we&#39;ve done has been.Please advise. Which should I use? Does it matter? What is the explanation for this final ?
Lab Drop and Select New Lab Hi,My sincere apologies if this issue already have been addressed. I am planning to drop my lab as I do not feel enough support in my lab and  switch into other   lab. Can I do it?If yes what are my next steps? Do I have to tell to new lab TA so that they can put me 2 lab grades?Once again I looked up everywhere and could find answer for this.
Interval Starter EdX Video I saw the Interval video on EdX and I know that the current course does not include the interval in the type comments. I was wondering if my code would be the correct/updated data definiton of SeatNumber from the video?;; SeatNum is Natural;; interp. a seat number in a row, 1 and 32 are aisle seats;; CONSTRAINT: if Natural, [1, 32]  
Question about the guard I had a question about the guard part; from today&#39;s m02-grade-standing-starter, when I submitted my codes with guard, the auto-grader saidTemplate intact : incorrect.However, when I removed all the  &#34;and&#34; and the guard, it gave me correct. So I was wondering if we are supposed to use a guard or not?
M02 lecture file submission issue I&#39;m ing to submit my lecture starter file, but it&#39;s showing a one-minute cooldown period. After waiting for the cooldown, I attempted to submit again, but I received an auto-grading error with a score of 0 out of 100. There&#39;s no specific error report, only a message stating, &#34;There is an error running the submission of &lt;file name&gt;.&#34; What should I do to fix these issues? 
Lecture exercises for marks? I know that on the syllabus it says that submitting exercises does not contribute to our lecture grade but on my autograder summary it shows that I have a 0 because I did not hand in one of the execises:I just wanted to make sure if the exercises we do during the lectures  were worth anything or are they just practice?

lecture starter Hi there,Are lecture starters for completion marks? I know it is suggested to be done, but just to double check it is not for both correctness and completion marks right?I submitted 2 of the lecture starter after 10pm and thus did not receive auto-grader feedbacks, will it affect my grade at all? Thank you 
Deadline for lecture problems Hello,If my memory is correct, the lecture problems are due at 17:00 on the day of the lecture.My concern is that I have a lab on Thursdays from 14:00 to 17:00, and I don&#39;t feel that I have enough time to complete the lecture problems in time.I also prefer to be able to have my lunch before this, making it difficult to balance things in my schedule.I am sure that although everybody&#39;s schedule is different, many others in this class have other classes or labs afterwards as well, and would benefit from a later deadline to hand in the lecture problems.Is it possible to have the deadline moved to a later time?Thank you
Do i need to follow the same  with cond as HTDD defined data If I had data defined as:Do I need to list them in the same order for the cond in the dd-template associated with it?Such as: ]    [ ]    [  ]or can I move around the three statements within the cond?

But I am not sure the mark could go down after TAs have a look in the real situation.Third, do we really, must follow the Design Recipe specifically for the template?In the template, it says use  cond expression for enumeration. Therefore, our function body follow it.if we have a better, simple solution like mine, can we just use template as   Or we just need to specifically, must follow the Design Recipe&#39;s template?
Lecture starter grade-standing Hi, I received this email and my question is if the order of the type comment should be the same as the order in dd-template-rules and the function below?  Also I wonder why autograder said that there is error indd-template. The rest of code is all correct and all test passed.
Data subclass meaning clarification Hi there, this is a really simply question but I just wanted to clarify that a subclass of data was referring to what type of data it is. Could a subclass of data be strings, numbers, images, etc? If my understanding is correct, I have a follow-up question as well. Are non-primitive data types also considered subclasses of data, or is there a different name of them? Thank you.

Edx Itemization seems counterarguments itself Hi. I will show the code first.   ]        [   ]        [ ]In the video, after we looked at the Data Driven Template for numbers, he mentioned that because of c could be String, we should guard   with .After that, because we know that c is not Boolean and Number, we do not need to guard with . Instead, Just put .My questions about this lecture are....1. Then why do we use [   ]Instead of[ ]Because there is only one case which c is number, so if c is number, it must be between 1 to 10.Therefore, I think we do not need  . They are redundant.2. If the above question is not, which we need to include the range of c, does it mean that we assume input c can be any number?

Question about lecture starter problem2 Why the autograder keep telling me “template intact”&#xff1f;How can i fix it&#xff1f;
Should we always be using guarding For guarding, should we just be always looking to add it to out code? or does it only apply to certain situations like the gradestanding problem? I think I might&#39;ve missed the explanation as my wifi was cutting out. Also why are the numbers [0,100] are atomic non-distinct, i don&#39;t think I quite get the definition.

Zoom Question Marks Is there a way to see our marks from answering past lecture zoom question
"Question Regarding Guards and Simplification of Guards in HtDD According to the video, if the subclass of our data definition is the last of its type, we can replace the cond question with the guard.Example:;; Data is one of:;; - &#34;A&#34;;; - Number, restricted to &gt; 0;; - &#34;B&#34;	  ]	      [  ]	      [ ]This can be simplified to:	  ]	      [ ]	      [ ]because Number &gt; 0 is the last subclass of its data type . Will we e marks for not simplifying the cond expression for Number?Edit: typos"

Hi guys, where are our grades posted For lab 1 and Pset 1

Lecture 2 starter problem 4 In yesterday&#39;s starter, for problem 4, it says:Design a function, called image&gt;, that takes two images and determines whether the first is larger than the second.I know we are supposed to put a &#34;?&#34; at the end of a function name that produces a boolean. So in this case, does it mean that if a function compares whether the first argument is greater than the second one, we put a &#34;&gt;&#34; at the end of the function name? The function produces a boolean though?Also, I was ing to look this up on the help-desk, however, I couldn&#39;t find anything. What would you suggest searching on the help-desk to find the answer to my question?Thank you!
Question on HtDF P3 - Boxify For the second practice problem in module 1b &#34;HtDF P3 - Boxify&#34;, I came across a question I was hoping I could get help with.

edx video area problem explained wrongly Hi. I am just following ae the edx video about HtDF. When he talked about a function that takes an image and returns the area of the image, the signature should be Image -&gt; Natural instead of Image -&gt; NumberBecause images are pixels, therefore the height and width must be natural number, so that the area must be the natural number.However, I tried to make a rectangle with floating point number, I can see that it works without error.I also checked the documentation for the rectangle, but it says &#34;real number not negative&#34; instead of &#34;natural number&#34;I guess he explained it wrongly in the video. Or might be version differences. Am I correct?
edX 1b Signature question The question is**Problem:** Design a function that pluralizes a given word.  For simplicity you may assume that just adding s is enough to pluralize a word.What is an appropriate signature for this function? Leave out the two semi-cos and the space, but otherwise be sure to get the capitalization and all other aspects of the signature correct.I tried both writing the signature   and the description  but i couldn't get the question right. What does this question want me to do?Thanks!Edit: nvm theyre using comments instead of tags

Now that Lab-01 is complete and graded, I assume we can discuss the solutions here. For my problem 5 solution, I used to collect the first character of the STR constant, which returns a char. I then usedto determine whether the first characters were equal. To declare the letter &#34;h&#34;, rather than using the string &#34;h&#34; , I used the character notation #\h. This resulted in t marks on my lab, which were not indicated by the autograder . I was wondering whether this solution also satisfies the problem statement, given that:&#34;Write an expression that computes whether the first character in the value of STR is &#34;h&#34;. If you do not change the constant definition for STR in the starter file, the expected result is .&#34;ETA: I know both my method and the substring method work. I was wondering if this is considered a valid solution for the lab, if an instructor could indicate. Thanks! 
Itemization rules The Itemization videos on edx state that one of the rules is that there must be 2 or more sublcasses with at least one that isn&#39;t distinct. However, one example in the video uses itemization for this data definition- Traffic light is one of: , &#34;red&#34;, &#34;yellow&#34;, &#34;green&#34; . Why does this data definition get exception from the rule?Additional Question: If the case above is actually an enumeration, do the rules relating to guards and relating to simplifying the cond questions apply?
Module Questions  Are the Dr Racket files/questions which are provided in some of the modules, are these questions mandatory to complete on Dr Racket and to be submitted via the auto grader or are they just for your own practice?
Grading report not showing up but handins are Handin files showing up but not the grading file. It takes a really g time for the grading file to show up. Had to wait almost 5hrs for it to come up.
HTDF Starter Testing Questions Hi in the problem 1 I encountered this feedback from the autograderTest thoroughness  icorrect - one or more tests caused an error.I ran the tests on racket and they did not produce an error. For reference the test that I had was.I did not understand why this error was produced. 
"HTDF Module 1 Lecture Starter Hi I was wondering about the test thoroughness of the problem 3 in the lecture starter. "" Design a function, that consumes an image and determines whether it is tall""For this, is it suggested to test for multiple shapes like circles and triangles, or does only one shape . I was wondering because in the solution, the only shape included is rectangle."
Atomic distinct vs. Atomic non-distinct According to the design recipes page, atomic distinct includes &#34;colors, letter grades, provinces etc&#34;. However, city names are atomic non-distinct in the edx videos. What differences are there between the names of cities and the names of provinces, such that one is atomic non-distinct and another is atomic distinct?Edit: Could it be based on the context of how it is designed?While city name is atomic non-distinct when the data does not specify which city , it becomes atomic distinct when it becomes part of the &#34;one-of&#34; .
Where can we see our grade? I know that there are autograder, but it could change.I can see that grades in Canvas for Lab 1 and Problem Set 1 are not graded yet.When, and where can we check our actual grades?
Problem set Hi there,I noticed that on canvas 11 problem sets are scheduled, however, on the course schedule calendar only 7 show up. Which one should we follow?Thank you 
Forgotten water bottle at lab today Hi there! I left my water bottle at my lab in the ICICS/CS building in room X260 this evening. I was wondering what the best way for me to retrieve it would be. If anyone noticed it and picked it up or knows where I can go to find t items in the ICICS/CS building, please let me know!
Lecture Starters Submission Time Hi,I know that the lecture starters are not for marks. However, I believe we are supposed to submit them, if I&#39;m not mistaken? Does it matter when they are submitted? Sometimes I don&#39;t have time to immediately work on them immediately after the lecture ends as I have classes right after. I was not aware we were submitting them last lecture. So I&#39;m ing to get them done ASAP. Is this a big issue? Thanks!
Problem Set Notifications Hi everyone, I was wondering how we can set up notifications for when a new problem set drops. That would be very helpful. Thank you.
Program ran out of memory When I was ing to run the HtDF lecture starter today this popped up. What does this mean and is there a way to fix it?
Is the lecture recording from today uploaded? And also where do I ess the recordings? 
Signature Error Confusion When I run the file that I completed for today&#39;s HTDF lecture starter, this error comes up. What does the error mean? I use the &#34; -&gt;&#34; symbol.
Template Origin Tag Error Whenever I attempt to run this program this error pops up, but if I comment out the template origin it states all tests pass I was wondering how I would correct this?
EdgeX Examples HiDo we need to submit our code for the Edge examples? Like the Modules?
Error on Problem 3 from the Lecture Problems ; Produce  if image is tall               True              False              True                            I keep getting this error saying &#34;check-expect cannot compare functions&#34;--I think it might have to do with the &gt; primitive or the fact that it&#39;s a Boolean? Or the fact that image-height and image width are expressions? I also think I might have missed something in class because I&#39;m not sure what the neutral descriptor for a Boolean value is  so I&#39;m not sure how to include that and that might be the problem.
difference between solution and my work? these are the check-expects that i created for the starter. i edited it to use &#34;oranges&#34; when originally i had &#34;flour&#34;, still with the same score that will be shown below.and these are the check-expects in the solutionthis is the score i received from autograderwhat is the difference between my work and the solution that causes my score to be 2.1% instead of 4.2%?
problem set submission i see on canvas theres an assignment for the problem sets. do we have to submit our code onto canvas? or is autograder all we have to do 
Edx video different from lecture content? I&#39;m watching the edx videos and the video does not show the same steps as we learned in the lecture, such as lack of usage of metatags. Should we still design functions as we learnt in the lecture?
HTDF Starter: Function Naming Convention for Problem 4 Hi,The function name of problem 4 is a bit ambiguous and contradictory to the style rule and I would like clarification on what we are supposed to do if we were to design a function similar to what question 4 is asking on an exam/midterm. More specifically, the function name given in the problem is image&gt; which takes in 2 images and produces a Boolean output. However, the Style Rules states the following: &#34;functions that produce Boolean should have names that end in ? pass? or aisle?.&#34;Is there a specific clause that states to not use ? for naming functions outputting a Boolean that I&#39;m missing or is this intentional?Thank you!
What does this mean? Test thoroughness : incorrect - missing one or more cases.
Does lecture questions count toward our marks Hi, on the syllabus it says the lecture questions are due 5pm after the lecture, but in piazza it says lecture questions does not count for marks. What does it mean?
HTDF lecture starter solution link not working https://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/lectures/m01-htdf-solution.rktdoes not actually work
Thoroughness for tests in htdf-starter questions 3 and 4 For the final problem of the lecture 2 starters, I have been having trouble getting the tests correct. Despite ing everything that comes to mind I keep being told that I am &#34;missing one or more cases&#34; for thoroughness in problem 4. Here are my current tests for the question:                                    #                                    #                                    #              #
m01-htdf-starter question 2. Hello,I am working on the test of thoroughness for question 2.I tried different words, numbers, and mixtures of them but still got a case missing.Does anyone have any idea about it?Thanks!
Unable to score 100% on m01-htdf I have tried adding every check-expect I can think of for problem #1 for today&#39;s lecture questions , but I keep getting a 0% for Test thoroughness. I imagine this is an issue with the autograder, but I want to confirm that I am not overlooking something major.The autograder feedback:0%  of   3.6%  x      Test thoroughness : incorrect - one or more tests caused an error. None of my tests cause errors, and they are all passed correctly:All 26 tests passed!Check-expects :                                                                                                                                                          
No Zoom polls pop up at all Hi,When the polls are launched, I see absolutely nothing on my end/no polls pop up. I&#39;ve never had this issue on zoom before. I am using a mac and zoom is updated/I am signed into my zoom ount.I tried troubleshooting this issue online but have not found any solutions beyond 1. updating zoom and 2. logging in, both of which I have done. Does anyone have any suggestions?Furthermore, if this continues to be an issue is there any way to answer the questions aside from zoom polls?Edit: Also, I think at points Dr Kiczale was pointing something out about the poll distribution on his screen but I couldn&#39;t see that either??
the deadline for submitting lecture exercises after lecture and do they make up lecture grades hi, I want to ask is submitting the lecture exercises after lecture, part of our lecture grade? I think this isn&#39;t clarified on the syllabus.And I also want to make sure that the deadline is 5pm, not 10 pm right? Because I believe the deadline the professor set up for this in the first lecture was 10pm.Thank you!&#34;While submitting the exercises during lecture does not contribute to your lecture grade, working through them with the instructor during lecture is essential to your learning. You will receive real-time feedback from the auto-grader during lecture, and you have until 5:00 PM on the day of your lecture to continue working on the exercies if you are not able to finish them during lecture.&#34;
Unable to attend Section 102: Zoom keeps disconnecting I am attending the Zoom Class right now at the IKB library. But the wifi is not stable and I keep disconnecting from the Zoom meeting every 20 minutes. For now, the poll questions are not worth any marks but in future lectures when they are worth the marks what happens if my Zoom meeting disconnects when there is a poll question/test on the way?
Zoom Poll Timer There&#39;s no timer for a lot of people&#39;s zoom polls , and I don&#39;t know how g I have left. Is there a way to fix this?
zoom polls credits Hi, I want to ask because that since each lecture doesn&#39;t necessarily have the same amount of zoom polls, how are they calculated for our credits? For example, if we answered one poll wrong among eleven polls, how will our zoom attendance credit for that lecture look like?
I&#39;m not familiar with zoom polls I didn&#39;t know how the zoom polls work before. I thought I can simply choose the answer and wait till the time is up. So I missed one of the questions today.Does today&#39;s poll grade count toward the final grade?
Function design check with booleans When we write functions expecting to return a boolean like question 3 from the htdf lecture, are we supposed to not expect that the test returns fail for all checks because the checks when returning booleans do need to return  ? or should tests only be  when we design functions returning images, strings, etc. 
HtDF Lecture Starters question 4 Hi there,I want to clarify how we classify as one image bigger than the other in question 4 of the lecture starters for today. I would assume simply comparing just the height of the images would not be enough to classify as one bigger than the other. I have to tried to look through Dr Racket&#39;s manual and could not seem to find a function that would produce the area of the image. Are there any specific functions that would help me in the manual?Thanks
read-syntax: expected a cing `&#34;` Hi everyone. I have my brackets ced but it appears as expected a cing `&#34;`. The code was running until just now but it suddenly turned red and is not working anymore. Thanks in advance!
Where do I find my autograder score for the problem set solutions? As title, I know its sounds like a stupid question but I forget where we can find the score online.
Lecture Submission - Auto Grader Hi, For lecture primitive submission , I thought the due was 10pm, and I submitted my file before 10pm, but I didn&#39;t know what I was thinking, I identally submitted incomplete one after 10pm, and it got marked... and recorded in summary. Do I still get submission grade after the due time? .Thank you!!
Keyboard Shortcut for Commenting What is the keyboard shortcut  for commenting several lines in Dr. Racket? If there isn&#39;t one is there a way I can comment lines of code using my keyboard?Thanks so much for your help and support. : 
My program won&#39;t run because of this problem: read-syntax: expected a `` to ce `` I am not sure what I am doing wrong here, I just copied the expression from an edx video.
Does poll question count to your grade? My zoom couldn&#39;t open and couldn&#39;t quit no matter how many times I force quit it. So in the first 7min I couldn&#39;t do the poll question.
Error message &#34;topple: Cannot find define for this function name&#34; Hello! I am in the lecture right now and I am following ag with the code for problem 1. However when I comment out the stub, I get this error message for the line  that says topple is not defined. Can someone help with this?
Zoom clicker questions Hi! There seemed to be an issue with zoom and I was unable to see two polls and clicking submit on others did not seem to work. Will grades be affected because of this since it was a technical fault?Thanks
Lecture Questions I am attending a lecture, but I&#39;ve encountered an issue with Zoom polls as it hasn&#39;t displayed any questions. I did manage to see the initial question on the polls, but it seems like I&#39;m the only one encountering these problems, as other students appear to have no trouble answering the Zoom polls.Could someone kindly provide me with guidance on how to locate and respond to the questions during the lecture?
Missed zoom poll Hi, during the lecture, I identally missed a participation zoom poll. Will it affects my grades?Thank you 
Missing the 1st day of the Lab. Would that be okay? Is there anything important or graded on the first day of the Lab? I just got into a lab section which is on Monday; so there is no way I can take the first section of the Lab...
Lab1 Task 4 Hi!I missed my laboratory section  because of a delayed study permit, and would like some help with Task 4.I&#39;m assuming we have to produce a working &#39;if expression&#39; to answer the prompt because of the assigned videos, but I don&#39;t understand how a single expression involving Booleans can lead to three possible answers . Would we be allowed to explore the use of other primitives/expressions to answer this, or is there something  I haven&#39;t tried?
Question about missing string in BSL P16 Hey I was just wondering about where the string &#34;abc&#34; went in line 34 for BSL P16.I checked with the answer key and it also wasn&#39;t there, is this some kind of typo or am I missing something about the &#34;if&#34; expression I am not aware about?

Passed Challenge Exam Hi,I just received the email of my challenge exam score. I passed the challenge exam and chose to use the exam score to replace my course. I replied the email to CPSC110 team, but did not receive a response yet. Do I need to attend tomorrow&#39;s class as usual?Many thanks!
Problem Set Solutions Hi,I could not find the answer for my question. Can someone elaborate/guide will it be ok if we discuss our problem sets after we have submitted or due date passed with TA in TA office hours.The reason I wanna do that is to learn the mistakes and fix it for the future. Obviously I will not be still discussing the concepts and not asking any code results.Thank you

Function Definitions Hi,I have a question regarding Functions.I understand that to form a Function we give it a name  and parameters like this one:  My question/confusion comes when we write the body. Should it be only pr expression including the parameters? For Ex:is this correct? or is it to be only one process like only multiply or addition ?Thank you
What to include in a signature for a function I was wondering what exactly should be included in a signature; for example, if I have a function that takes in two numbers and outputs one, should it be:```;;Number Number -> Number```Or do I only include the main units being altered 
Grade of Lecture Hi, i saw that there is 10% lecture grade. I want to know how to get during the lecture.
Lecture 110 101 is assigned an in-person classroom In my timetable my CPSC110 section 101 lecture is assigned to the class LSK 462.I read a past post; @112 about lecture attendance, the instructor&#39;s response indicates that all lectures and office hours are held online, and all other class activities are held in person Just wanted to clarify that I do go to LSK 462 for the 110 lecture, as there was no post about the online lectures moving to in person. I understand CPSC 110 is hybrid, but the instructor&#39;s response indicates only labs and tutorials are in person but not lectures.Thanks!edit: nevermind I think I figure it out, I apologize
Search in help desk not working hi, I used the search in help for the radial-star question on Edx, but when I clicked on it the link only showed a blank web page with the sentence &#34;Please go here&#34;, and when I clicked on it it still didn&#39;t direct me anywhere, does anyone know how to fix this?the link is file:///private/var/folders/qs/kv5gl9p16cn7n908lxcbz4rr0000gn/T/plt-sendurl-contents-file-16943736981694373698548.html
Do lecture starters count towards the lecture grade? I was unaware of the 10PM deadline, and I have since improved my lecture starter grades since the report in the SUMMARY folder came in.Do lecture starters make any part in our lecture grade? Or is it solely the Zoom poll questions that are mentioned in the syllabus?

Change constant to image in definition window this is a screenshot from edX video. 1a : Beginning Student Language / Booleans and if Expressions, pt 3We were supposed to evaluate the if expression above. The first step is to reduce the expression to the corresponding value, which is the image shown. I have been wondering how to do that in the definition window. Any helps are appreciated, thank you!

Lecture 2 prework Hi, I just wanted to ask whether or not the lecture index contains all of the work we should do for the course excluding psets, and labs. I am reading the lecture 2 &#34;before lecture section&#34;  but it doesn&#39;t seem to have any actual prework. This is just a little confusing for me since the previous lecture says there is prework before lecture 2. Is this intentional, or am I missing something?Thanks!

Primitive Starter Problem 2 Hi, I did the primitive starter problem 2 a slightly different way than the solution, but the autograder gives an error saying that it &#34;found a definition that is not at the top level&#34;I am not sure what this means, is there something wrong with the function I am using, or should I not be using functions at all? I am pretty sure using a function instead of repeating each line is also a valid way of answering the question. Appreciate any help, thanks. 
HtDF @signature and @template-origin Type Expectations For the How to Design Functions module. we are expected to provide the expected type inputs and outputs to a function in the @signature and the expected input in @template-origin. The teaching material indicates that this typing should be as specific as possible. How can I be certain that the function call will only allow a &#39;Natural&#39; rather than just a &#39;Number&#39; without forcing this typing within the function? I understand that the output can be specified, but how can I know the input will follow the type expectations I set for it?Ag this line of thought, to determine the most specific typing, are we expected to know all the types available in Racket? 
Autograder Not Working  Hi,I have submitted the problem set 1 except the last question. Submission is successful but when I check in Autograder it does not show my submission and feedback. Is there any issue right now?Thanks in advance
Lab restriction The lab that is restricted seems still have seats available , can I join either L1R or L1U, because currently I do not have available lab.
DrRacket and the 80 or 102 character limit per line - Why? So I ran into this problem today when ing to hand in my assignment, which was a shock at first leading me to look around in DrRacket only to realize that this is very much intended  and what seems to be part of the design of the program, at least from what I could see. I relented and ended up spending some time to split a bunch of my comment lines until i could finally submit the file. However, even though the article had provided its own reasoning I failed to see the point of it. Yes, ger lines may be harder to display on some screens and will require the use of the scroll bar to read fully. But an arbitrary character limit does not seem very intuitive. The lecture starter in question was fairly simple and had short lines of code, but what happens when more complicated code that needs more space to be expressed? I do not think every single line of code can be easily split into multiple lines without either causing problems or at the very least look kind of messy.Maybe there is some unspoken explanation relating to workplace habits or something like &#34;if it is too g and cannot be split easily your code is bad&#34; out there. But I could not really find any discussion about this character limit, only that it exists and there was a little blurb written about it.

Racket Installation I installed Racket from the link on the CPSC 110 site  on my Windows laptop using the x64, 64-bit version 8.10 to fit my laptop but when I open the app, it looks very different than what I&#39;ve seen and I can&#39;t find the option to configure language settings. I uninstalled V8.10 and tried 8.9 but it&#39;s the same thing. I also see it as &#34;Racket&#34; instead of &#34;DrRacket&#34; if that matters? Not sure what&#39;s wrong since I used the link from the course site.

Primitive/Function Starters Some people seem to be thinking that the starter activities are for marks, but I was under the impression that they were simply just for us to practice? 
office hours I just tried joining the Zoom link for office hours and it appeared to be ced. It read &#34;waiting for the host to start meeting.&#34; However, the timetable says that office hours run on Thursdays until 6:30 pm. Is this correct?
Module 1A Due Date Hello, I was just wondering when Module 1A is due? Should we complete them for the next lecture or should they be done the day of each lecture?
Question about submissions After I finished the functions starter and the primitives starter problems, and the&#39;ve all been sent to autograder through the SPD Handin, is there nothing  to do to make sure my work has been handed in for the night and counted ? Or do I have to submit the files somewhere 
Autograder Cooldown TIme I just submitted my first attempt for PSet 1 and the Cooldown time seems to be an hour. Is that the normal cooldown time for the first Problem Set? If the cooldown time increases over the term, will the cooldown time for the later PSets be something like a day?

Lecture Attendance I&#39;m in 110 102, and on checking my SSC on my phone, no building was indicated and I assumed I&#39;d have to join the Zoom meeting. However, on checking my timetable again on my laptop, it says to attend at IRC - 4. Just wanted to ask, do I have the option to attend lectures online or at the above location? If I show up in-person, will there be an instrcutor there or would I still just be joining a Zoom call?

Quesion about SPD handin Why it keeps telling me “submission used to much memory” &#xff1f;
Regarding lecture work hand in When is the deadline to hand in lecture work? Do we still get to work on it after lecture? Also would it be fine if we have extra code  in our file? Or should we open a separate file to do the testings? Would the auto grader grade it wrong in the case of having extra code?
SPD Handin error I tried handin for the primitive starter file for lecture 01, but I am constantly encountering the error &#34;File @cwl tag is missing or incorrectly edited.&#34;, This was not a problem when I tried handin for the test file when setting up DrRacket, where I entered my CWL username and password correctly. I retyped my entire username and password again when I want to handin the starter file today yet this error occurred. Just wondering what should be done to prevent this from happening. Thanks.

Conflict between scheduled Midterm 1 &amp; 2 and CPSC 121 Lecture Hi there, I know that UBC has procedures to follow if one has a scheduling conflict between midterms for different classes. I am not sure about the scheduling conflicts between midterms and classes. I believe this might be of interest to students who take CPSC 110 and CPSC 121 Section 103. I can see on the course schedule that midterms are scheduled for the following timeslots:MT1 - October 5  at 6 pmMT2 - November 16  at 6 pmHowever, the CPSC 121 Section 103 is scheduled to start at 5 pm and end at 6:30 pm on Thursdays. There is an overlap of 30 minutes for when the MT1 &amp;2 are scheduled.Given everything stated above, what will be the best course of action to mitigate the time overlaps between scheduled midterms and CPSC 121 class? Is there an individual in the CPSC department who will be able to advise on this one? This might be too early to bring up...Thank you for your responses in advance!Kind regards,

Urgent question about cpsc110 waitlist   As a freshman who sincerely and eager to join the cpsc110 course, I just noticed that the registration number of cpsc110 1w1 is 0, and the remaining seats of cpsc110 101 is 44. Does this mean that once I join cpsc1101w1, it can guarantee me add in cpsc110? In addition, are students in the cpsc110 1w2 list likely to be added to cpsc110 101 when cpsc110 101 is available?
